RAW OPENAI RESPONSE (gpt-4o-mini):
============================================================
TYPE: <class 'str'>
LEN: 375
CONTENT: SIGNAL: HOLD  
CONFIDENCE: 0.7  
REASONING: The current RSI of 50 indicates a neutral position, and the price is in a downtrend. Given the low trading volume, this further suggests a lack of strong momentum in either direction. With unclear signals and the absence of strong support or resistance based on the EMAs, it is prudent to hold until clearer trading signals emerge.
