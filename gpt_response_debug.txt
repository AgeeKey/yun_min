RAW OPENAI RESPONSE (gpt-4o-mini):
============================================================
TYPE: <class 'str'>
LEN: 479
CONTENT: SIGNAL: HOLD  
CONFIDENCE: 0.7  
REASONING: The current RSI at 45.14 suggests that the market is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral condition. The price is slightly above the EMA Fast and EMA Slow values, which implies that there may be some upward pressure, but not strong enough to confirm a clear trend. Given the conflicting indicators and the lack of a strong buying or selling signal, holding is the most prudent choice until further confirmation arises.
